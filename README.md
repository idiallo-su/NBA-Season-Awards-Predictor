Machine Learning and Python-based predictor to assist in selecting the winner of certain awards in the NBA (National Basketball Association) season.

Program relies heavily on Twitter API to mine tweets/hashtags from voters (journalists, broadcasters etc) and fans that contain the names (first and/or last) as well as aliases of various players in the NBA using certain text mining libraries/techniques such as NLK, Spacy etc.
This data would be beneficial in getting the sentimental score of each player based on the number of positive, neutral and negative tweets attributed to a player. Coupled up with the player's statistics, we can suitably predict the winner of a certain award.

Along with our project is a Machine Learning (ML) model that we have tailored to be able to predict the winner by passing tweets from previous seasons to see if the predicted winner will match the actual winner of the awards of those previous years.
